Kinda like apt-get but for Bukkit!

Get latest builds here (stable most of the time): http://dw.networkery.co/bukkitdev/BPM/

Open cmd up and run bpm (from within a Bukkit server root directory preferably) and then look at the output which is the help file and figure out how to use it yourself LOL.

Can't quite understand how everything connects? Here, have a code map: http://dw.networkery.co/bukkitdev/BPM/other/BPM%20Code%20Map.png
